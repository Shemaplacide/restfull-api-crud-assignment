#  E-Commerce Product Management API

A RESTful API built with **Spring Boot** and **PostgreSQL** that allows you to manage products in an e-commerce system. This project was built as an assignment to practice and demonstrate full **CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) using a clean, layered Java architecture.

##  What is CRUD?

CRUD stands for the four basic operations you can do with data:

| Letter | Operation | What it means |
|--------|-----------|----------------|
| **C** | Create | Add a new product to the database |
| **R** | Read | View one or all products |
| **U** | Update | Edit an existing product |
| **D** | Delete | Remove a product from the database |

This project implements all four operations through REST API endpoints.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Technology | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **Java 23** | Programming language |
| **Spring Boot 4.0.2** | Framework for building the API |
| **Spring Data JPA** | Simplifies database operations |
| **Hibernate ORM** | Maps Java objects to database tables |
| **PostgreSQL 18** | Database to store products |
| **Maven** | Manages project dependencies |
| **Postman** | Used to test the API endpoints |

---

##  Project Architecture

The project is organized into **3 layers**. Each layer has a specific responsibility and they work together like a chain:

```
[ Client / Postman ]
        ↓
  Controller Layer       ← Receives HTTP requests and sends responses
        ↓
  Service Layer          ← Contains the business logic and rules
        ↓
  Repository Layer       ← Talks directly to the database
        ↓
  PostgreSQL Database    ← Where all product data is stored
```

### What each layer does in this project:

- **ProductController.java** — Defines all the API endpoints (URLs). When you send a request to `/api/products`, this class receives it and decides what to do.
- **ProductService.java** — Contains the actual logic. For example, before saving a product, it checks if a product with the same ID already exists.
- **ProductRepository.java** — Uses Spring Data JPA to run database queries without writing SQL manually.
- **Product.java** — The model/entity that represents what a product looks like in the database.

```

---

##  Product Entity (What a Product Looks Like)

Every product stored in the database has these fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | Long | Unique identifier for each product |
| `name` | String | Name of the product |
| `description` | String | Details about the product |
| `price` | Double | Price of the product |
| `category` | String | Category it belongs to (e.g., Electronics) |
| `stockQuantity` | Integer | How many units are available |
| `brand` | String | Brand name of the product |

---

##  Database Configuration

In the `application.properties` file, the app is configured to connect to a local PostgreSQL database:

```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/ecommerce_db
spring.datasource.username=postgres
spring.datasource.password=admin
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
spring.jpa.show-sql=true
```

> **Note:** `ddl-auto=update` means Hibernate will automatically create or update the product table in the database when the app starts. You do not need to create the table manually.

---

## 📡 API Endpoints (The CRUD Operations Explained)

### Base URL
```
http://localhost:8080/api/products
```

---

###  1. CREATE — Add a New Product
**Method:** `POST`  
**URL:** `/api/products`

**What happens behind the scenes:**
1. You send a JSON body with the product details
2. `ProductController` receives the request and calls `productService.addNewProduct()`
3. `ProductService` checks if a product with that ID already exists in the database
4. If it exists → returns `409 CONFLICT` with message "Product already exists"
5. If it does not exist → saves the product and returns `201 CREATED`

**Request Body:**
```json
{
    "id": 1001,
    "name": "Wireless Bluetooth Headphones",
    "description": "Premium noise-cancelling wireless headphones with 30-hour battery life",
    "price": 89.99,
    "category": "Electronics",
    "stockQuantity": 150,
    "brand": "TechSound"
}
```

**Success Response:** `201 CREATED`

### Base URL
```
http://localhost:8080/api/products
```

---

### ➕ 1. CREATE — Add a New Product
**Method:** `POST`  
**URL:** `/api/products`

**What happens behind the scenes:**
1. You send a JSON body with the product details
2. `ProductController` receives the request and calls `productService.addNewProduct()`
3. `ProductService` checks if a product with that ID already exists in the database
4. If it exists → returns `409 CONFLICT` with message "Product already exists"
5. If it does not exist → saves the product and returns `201 CREATED`

**Request Body:**
```json
{
    "id": 1001,
    "name": "Wireless Bluetooth Headphones",
    "description": "Premium noise-cancelling wireless headphones with 30-hour battery life",

```json
"Product with id 1001 already exists"
```

---

### 📋 2. READ — Get All Products
**Method:** `GET`  
**URL:** `/api/products`

**What happens behind the scenes:**
1. You send a GET request with no body
2. `ProductController` calls `productService.getAllProducts()`
3. `ProductService` calls `productRepository.findAll()` which fetches every product from the database
4. Returns the full list with `200 OK`

**Response:** `200 OK`
```json
[
    {
        "id": 1001,
        "name": "Wireless Bluetooth Headphones",
        "description": "Premium noise-cancelling wireless headphones",

    }
]
```

---

### 🔍 3. READ — Get a Single Product by ID
**Method:** `GET`  
**URL:** `/api/products/{id}`  
**Example:** `/api/products/1001`

**What happens behind the scenes:**
1. You provide the product ID in the URL
2. `ProductController` calls `productService.getProductById(id)`
3. `ProductService` uses `productRepository.findById(id)` to look for the product
4. If found → returns the product with `200 OK`
5. If not found → throws a `RuntimeException` and returns `404 NOT FOUND`

**Success Response:** `200 OK`
```json
{
    "id": 1001,
    "name": "Wireless Bluetooth Headphones",
    "price": 89.99,
    "category": "Electronics",
    "stockQuantity": 150,
    "brand": "TechSound"

"Product not found with id: 1001"
```

---

### ✏️ 4. UPDATE — Edit an Existing Product
**Method:** `PUT`  
**URL:** `/api/products/{id}`  
**Example:** `/api/products/1001`

**What happens behind the scenes:**
1. You provide the ID in the URL and the new details in the request body
2. `ProductController` calls `productService.updateProduct(id, product)`
3. `ProductService` first fetches the existing product using `getProductById(id)`
4. It then replaces all the old field values (name, price, description, etc.) with the new ones
5. Saves the updated product back to the database and returns it with `200 OK`
6. If the product does not exist → returns `404 NOT FOUND`

**Request Body:**
```json
{
    "name": "Wireless Bluetooth Headphones Pro",
    "description": "Upgraded version with better sound quality",
    "price": 99.99,
    "category": "Electronics",
    "stockQuantity": 200,
    "brand": "TechSound"
}
```

**Success Response:** `200 OK` — Returns the full updated product

**If not found:** `404 NOT FOUND`
```json
"Product not found with id: 1001"
```

---

### 🗑️ 5. DELETE — Remove a Product
**Method:** `DELETE`  
**URL:** `/api/products/{id}`  
**Example:** `/api/products/1001`

**What happens behind the scenes:**
1. You provide the product ID in the URL
2. `ProductController` calls `productService.deleteProduct(id)`
3. `ProductService` checks if the product exists using `productRepository.existsById(id)`
4. If it exists → deletes it and returns `200 OK`
5. If it does not exist → returns `404 NOT FOUND` without crashing

**Success Response:** `200 OK`
```json
"Product deleted successfully"
```

**If not found:** `404 NOT FOUND`
```json
"Product not found with id: 1001"
```

---

### 🔎 6. SEARCH — Find Products by Category
**Method:** `GET`  
**URL:** `/api/products/search?category={category}`  
**Example:** `/api/products/search?category=Electronics`

**What happens behind the scenes:**
1. You pass a category name as a query parameter
2. `ProductService` calls `productRepository.findByCategory(categoryName)`
3. Spring Data JPA automatically builds the SQL query from the method name
4. Returns all matching products or `404 NOT FOUND` if none exist

---

### 🔎 7. SEARCH — Find Products by Price and Brand
**Method:** `GET`  
**URL:** `/api/products/searchByPriceAndBrand?price={price}&brand={brand}`  
**Example:** `/api/products/searchByPriceAndBrand?price=89.99&brand=TechSound`

**What happens behind the scenes:**
1. You pass both price and brand as query parameters
2. `ProductService` calls `productRepository.findByPriceAndBrand(price, brand)`
3. Returns all products that match both conditions
